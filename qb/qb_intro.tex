			\begin{itemize}
				\item $x$ is revealed piece by piece
				\item Algorithm gives answer when it wants
				\item \emph{Last} observed part of $x$ usually important / useful
			\end{itemize}
		\item Learning incremental classification when costs are known via decision trees~\cite{norton-89,nunez-91,turney-95,davis-06} or Markov decision process~\cite{zubek-02,ji-07}
		\item In contrast we're going to focus on a problem whose structure is inherently incremental

Title:

Big Data Analysis with Topic Models: Human Interaction and Social
Science Applications

Abstract:

A common information need is to understand large, unstructured
datasets: millions of e-mails during e-discovery, a decade worth of
science correspondence, or a day's tweets.  In the last decade, topic
models have become a common tool for navigating such datasets.  This
talk investigates the foundational research that allows successful
tools for these data exploration tasks: how to know when you have an
effective model of the dataset; how to correct bad models; how to
measure topic model effectiveness; and how to detect framing and spin
using these techniques.  After introducing topic models, I argue why
traditional measures of topic model quality---borrowed from machine
learning---are inconsistent with how topic models are actually used.
In response, I describe interactive topic modeling, a technique that
enables users to impart their insights and preferences to models in a
principled, interactive way.  I will then address measuring topic
model effectiveness in real-world tasks.  Finally, I'll discuss
ongoing collaborations with political scientists to use these
techniques to detect spin and framing in political and online
interactions.

Big Data Analysis with Topic Models: Human Interaction, Streaming
Computation, and Social Science Applications

Abstract:

A common information need is to understand large, unstructured
datasets: millions of e-mails during e-discovery, a decade worth of
science correspondence, or a day's tweets.  In the last decade, topic
models have become a common tool for navigating such datasets.  This
talk investigates the foundational research that allows successful
tools for these data exploration tasks: how to know when you have an
effective model of the dataset; how to correct bad models; how to
scale to large datasets; and how to detect framing and spin using
these techniques.  After introducing topic models, I argue why
traditional measures of topic model quality---borrowed from machine
learning---are inconsistent with how topic models are actually used.
In response, I describe interactive topic modeling, a technique that
enables users to impart their insights and preferences to models in a
principled, interactive way.  I will then address computational and
statistical limits to existing approaches and how streaming topic
models, with an "infinite vocabulary", can be applied to real-world
online datasets.  Finally, I'll discuss ongoing collaborations with
political scientists to use these techniques to detect spin and
framing in political and online interactions.

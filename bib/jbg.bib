	Abstract = {Probabilistic topic models are important tools for indexing, summarizing, and analyzing large document collections by their themes.  However, promoting end-user understanding of topics remains an open research problem.  We compare labels generated by users given four topic visualization techniques—word lists, word lists with bars, word clouds, and network graphs—against each other and against automatically generated labels.  Our basis of comparison is participant ratings of how well labels describe documents from the topic. Our study has two phases: a labeling phase where participants label visualized topics and a validation phase where different participants select which labels best describe the topics' documents.  Although all visualizations produce similar quality labels, simple visualizations such as word lists allow participants to quickly understand topics, while complex visualizations take longer but expose multi-word expressions that simpler visualizations obscure.  Automatic labels lag behind user-created labels, but our dataset of manually labeled topics highlights linguistic patterns (e.g., hypernyms, phrases) that can be used to improve automatic topic labeling algorithms.},

    abstract = {{A method is presented for calculating the amount of information conveyed to a hearer by a speaker emitting a sentence generated by a probabilistic grammar known to both parties. The method applies the work of Grenander (1967) to the intermediate states of a top-down parser. This allows the uncertainty about structural ambiguity to be calculated at each point in a sentence. Subtracting these values at successive points gives the information conveyed by a word in a sentence. Word-by-word information conveyed is calculated for several small probabilistic grammars, and it is suggested that the number of bits conveyed per word is a determinant of reading times and other measures of cognitive load.}},

We use this fact to build a model of media bias in which firms slant their reports toward the prior beliefs of their customers in order to build a reputation for quality. Bias emerges in our model even though it can make all market participants worse off. The model predicts that bias will be less severe when consumers receive independent evidence on the true state of the world, and that competition between independently owned news outlets can reduce bias. We present a variety of empirical evidence consistent with these predictions.},

@article{landauer-04,
    abstract = {{Most techniques for relating textual information rely on intellectually created links such as author-chosen keywords and titles, authority indexing terms, or bibliographic citations. Similarity of the semantic content of whole documents, rather than just titles, abstracts, or overlap of keywords, offers an attractive alternative. Latent semantic analysis provides an effective dimension reduction method for the purpose that reflects synonymy and the sense of arbitrary word combinations. However, latent semantic analysis correlations with human text-to-text similarity judgments are often empirically highest at ≈300 dimensions. Thus, two- or three-dimensional visualizations are severely limited in what they can show, and the first and/or second automatically discovered principal component, or any three such for that matter, rarely capture all of the relations that might be of interest. It is our conjecture that linguistic meaning is intrinsically and irreducibly very high dimensional. Thus,
some method to explore a high dimensional similarity space is needed. But the 2.7 × 107 projections and infinite rotations of, for example, a 300-dimensional pattern are impossible to examine. We suggest, however, that the use of a high dimensional dynamic viewer with an effective projection pursuit routine and user control, coupled with the exquisite abilities of the human visual system to extract information about objects and from moving patterns, can often succeed in discovering multiple revealing views that are missed by current computational algorithms. We show some examples of the use of latent semantic analysis to support such visualizations and offer views on future needs.}},

The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering \${\cal C}\$ to clustering \${\cal C}'\$ . The criterion makes no assumptions about how the clusterings were generated and applies to both soft and hard clusterings. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed from the point of view of comparing clusterings. In particular, the VI is positive, symmetric and obeys the triangle inequality. Thus, surprisingly enough, it is a true metric on the space of clusterings. Keywords: Clustering; Comparing partitions; Measures of agreement; Information theory; Mutual information},

When learned topics are coherent and interpretable, they can be valuable for faceted browsing, results set diversity analysis, and document retrieval. However, when dealing with small collections or noisy text (e.g. web search result snippets or blog posts), learned topics can be less coherent, less interpretable, and less useful. To overcome this, we propose two methods to regularize the learning of topic models. Our regularizers work by creating a structured prior over words that reflect broad patterns in the external data. Using thirteen datasets we show that both regularizers improve topic coherence and interpretability while learning a faithful representation of the collection of interest. Overall, this work makes topic models more useful across a broader range of text data.

This paper presents Gibbs max-margin supervised topic models by minimizing an expected margin loss, an upper bound of the existing margin loss derived from an expected prediction rule. By introducing augmented variables, we develop simple and fast Gibbs sampling algorithms with no restricting assumptions and no need to solve SVM subproblems for both classification and regression. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements on time efficiency. The classification performance is also significantly improved over competitors.},

Overall, the volunteers enjoyed the spoiled stories more than the unspoiled stories; therefore, spoilers may actually increase suspense instead of decreasing it.}},

    abstract = {{We consider learning in a Markov decision process where we are not explicitly given a reward function, but where instead we can observe an expert demonstrating the task that we want to learn to perform. This setting is useful in applications (such as the task of driving) where it may be difficult to write down an explicit reward function specifying exactly how different desiderata should be traded off. We think of the expert as trying to maximize a reward function that is expressible as a linear combination of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the task demonstrated by the expert. Our algorithm is based on using "inverse reinforcement learning" to try to recover the unknown reward function. We show that our algorithm terminates in a small number of iterations, and that even though we may never recover the expert's reward function, the policy output by the algorithm will attain performance close to that of the expert, where here performance is measured with respect to the expert's  unknown  reward function.}},

A case study presents a workable method for general informetric analyses of the WWW. In detail, the paper describes a number of specific informetric analysis parameters. As a case study the Danish proportion of the WWWis compared to those of other Nordic countries. The method- ological approach is comparable with common bibliometric analyses of the ISI citation databases. Among other results the analyses demonstrate that Denmark would seem to fall seriously behind the other Nordic countries with respect to visibility on the Net and compared to its position in scientific databases.},

    Abstract = {This article is a survey of issues concerning the measurement of agreement among corpus annotators. It exposes the mathematics and underlying assumptions of agreement coefficients such as Cohens kappa and Krippendorffs alpha; relates these coefficients to explicit models of annotator error; discusses the use of coefficients in several annotation tasks; and argues that weighted, alpha-like coefficients, traditionally less used than kappa-like measures in Computational Linguistics, may be more appropriate for many corpus annotation tasks  but that their use makes the interpretation of the value of the coefficient even harder.},

Knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other organisms. The goal of the Gene Ontology Consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and changing. To this end, three independent ontologies accessible on the World-Wide Web (http://www.geneontology.org) are being constructed: biological process, molecular function and cellular component.},

@inproceedings{banko-07,
    Abstract = {Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) has focused on satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small homogeneous corpora (e.g., extract the location and time of seminars from a set of announcements). Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TextRunner, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TextRunner with KnowItAll, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TextRunner achieves an error reduction of 33\% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KnowItAll to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TextRunner extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TextRunner's 11,000,000 highest probability tuples and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000 more abstract assertions.},

We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.},

    abstract = {We describe a new method for visualizing topics, the distributions over terms
that are automatically extracted from large text corpora using latent variable
models. Our method finds significant \$n\$-grams related to a topic, which are
then used to help understand and interpret the underlying distribution.
Compared with the usual visualization, which simply lists the most probable
topical terms, the multi-word expressions provide a better intuitive impression
for what a topic is "about." Our approach is based on a language model of
arbitrary length expressions, for which we develop a new methodology based on
nested permutation tests to find significant phrases. We show that this method
outperforms the more standard use of \$\chi^2\$ and likelihood ratio tests. We
illustrate the topic presentations on corpora of scientific abstracts and news
articles.},

    Abstract = {In this article I examine cognates, lexical items from different languages which are identified by bilinguals as somehow being 'the same thing'. Cognates have at least 4 essential properties: 1) they are always structural units; 2) they are words; 3) words paired may be but need not be semantically identical; 4) there is always some kind of formal resemblance between cognates. I argue that these properties can be explained in terms of a particular model of lexical activation and word recognition, namely the Cohort Model. I also take up the question of defining cognates for psycho linguistic purposes and argue against using traditional extensional definitions based on etymology and genetic relatedness. I argue for defining cognates in terms of their structural representations and the processes which activate and select them.

A simple, intuitive derivation of this method is given along with guidance on implementation. Also discussed are two applications of the algorithm, one for implementing acceptance-rejection sampling when a blanketing function is not available and the other for implementing the algorithm with block-at-a-time scans. In the latter situation, many different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples.}},

@article{covi-00,
    Abstract = {Current research on the influence of electronic communication technologies such as electronic mail, World Wide Web, electronic journals, bibliographic databases and on-line card catalogs suggest that they broaden academic research communities and change the ways researchers work. However, it is less well-understood how these changes take place. One explanation is that the mechanism for change is generational: doctoral students transform research disciplines as they apply new electronic communication skills they ?grew up with.? This article examines this explanation and related claims through evidence from a study of 28 graduate students and their advisors in four disciplines at eight U.S. research universities. Although all the doctoral students used electronic communication technologies in various ways, their work practices reinforced existing patterns of work and resource use in their disciplines. Students used electronic communication to (1) mimic the electronic communication patterns of their advisor, (2) differentiate or specialize their research with respect to their advisor or research specialty, (3) enhance the social connections and material resources their advisor or institution provided to them, and/or (4) ease or improve ?hands-on? research techniques (textual analysis, wet lab work, programming, statistical analysis) that their advisor or research group delegated to them.},

    Abstract = {The distinction between syntax (sentence form) and semantics (sentence meaning) is fundamental to our thinking about language. Whether and where this distinction is represented at the neural level is still a matter of considerable debate. In the present fMRI study, we examined the neural correlates of syntactic and semantic functions using an innovative activation paradigm specifically designed to unequivocally disentangle syntactic from lexicosemantic aspects of sentence processing. Our findings strongly indicate that a part of Broca's area (BA 44, pars opercularis) is critically implicated in processing syntactic information, whereas the lower portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47, pars orbitalis) is selectively involved in processing the semantic aspects of a sentence.},

    Abstract = {The most basic assumption used in statistical learning theory is that training data and test data are drawn from the same underlying distribution. Unfortunately, in many applications, the "in-domain" test data is drawn from a distribution that is related, but not identical, to the "out-of-domain" distribution of the training data. We consider the common case in which labeled out-of-domain data is plentiful, but labeled in-domain data is scarce. We introduce a statistical formulation of this problem in terms of a simple mixture model and present an instantiation of this framework to maximum entropy classifiers and their linear chain counterparts. We present efficient inference algorithms for this special case based on the technique of conditional expectation maximization. Our experimental results show that our approach leads to improved performance on three real world tasks on four different data sets from the natural language processing domain.},

    Abstract = {{This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet, which is  the building of a multilingual database with lexical semantic networks  or wordnets for several European languages. Each wordnet in the  database represents a language-specific structure due to the unique  lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are inter-linked  via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where equivalent concepts across  languages should share the same index item. The flexible multilingual  design of the database makes it possible to compare the  lexicalizations and semantic structures, revealing answers to  fundamental linguistic and philosophical questions which could never  be answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic networks  across languages, what are the language-specific differences of these  networks, is there a language-universal ontology, how much information  can be shared across languages? First attempts to answer these  questions are given in the form of a set of shared or common Base  Concepts that has been derived from the separate wordnets and their  classification by a language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts  play a fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the  database may also serve many practical needs with respect to  (cross-language) information retrieval, machine translation tools,  language generation tools and language learning tools, which are  discussed in the final chapter. <br/>  The book offers an excellent introduction to the EuroWordNet project  for scholars in the field and raises many issues that set the  directions for further research in semantics and knowledge  engineering.}},

    Abstract = {{IBM Research undertook a challenge to build a computer system that could compete at the human champion level in real time on the American TV Quiz show, Jeopardy! The extent of the challenge includes fielding a real-time automatic contestant on the show, not merely a laboratory exercise. The Jeopardy! Challenge helped us address requirements that led to the design of the DeepQA architecture and the implementation of Watson. After 3 years of intense research and development by a core team of about 20 researches, Watson is performing at human expert-levels in terms of precision, confidence and speed at the Jeopardy! Quiz show. Our results strongly suggest that DeepQA is an effective and extensible architecture that may be used as a foundation for combining, deploying, evaluating and advancing a wide range of algorithmic techniques to rapidly advance the field of QA.}},

@article{genetag,
    Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Named entity recognition (NER) is an important first step for text mining the biomedical literature. Evaluating the performance of biomedical NER systems is impossible without a standardized test corpus. The annotation of such a corpus for gene/protein name NER is a difficult process due to the complexity of gene/protein names. We describe the construction and annotation of GENETAG, a corpus of 20K MEDLINE sentences for gene/protein NER. 15K GENETAG sentences were used for the BioCreAtIvE Task 1A Competition. RESULTS: To ensure heterogeneity of the corpus, MEDLINE sentences were first scored for term similarity to documents with known gene names and 10K high- and 10K low-scoring sentences were chosen at random. The original 20K sentences were run through a gene/protein name tagger and the results were modified manually to reflect a wide definition of gene/protein names subject to a specificity constraint, a rule that required the tagged entities to refer to specific entities. Each sentence in GENETAG was annotated with acceptable alternatives to the gene/protein names it contained, allowing for partial matching with semantic constraints. Semantic constraints are rules requiring the tagged entity to contain its true meaning in the sentence context. Application of these constraints results in a more meaningful measure of the performance of an NER system than unrestricted partial matching. CONCLUSION: The annotation of GENETAG required intricate manual judgments by annotators which hindered tagging consistency. The data were pre-segmented into words, to provide indices supporting comparison of system responses to the "gold standard". However, character-based indices would have been more robust than word-based indices. GENETAG Train, Test and Round1 data and ancillary programs are freely available at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/tanabe/GENETAG.tar.gz. A newer version of GENETAG-05, will be released later this year.},

    abstract = {We build dialogue system policies for negotiation, and in particular for argumentation. These dialogue policies are designed for negotiation against users of different cultural norms (individualists, collectivists, and altruists). In order to learn these policies we build simulated users {(SUs)}, i.e. models that simulate the behavior of real users, and use reinforcement learning {(RL).} The {SUs} are trained on a spoken dialogue corpus in a negotiation domain, and then tweaked towards a particular cultural norm using hand-crafted rules. We evaluate the learned policies in a simulation setting. Our results are consistent with our {SUs}, in other words, the policies learn what they are designed to learn, which shows that {RL} is a promising technique for learning policies in domains, such as argumentation, that are more complex than standard slot-filling applications.},

Why is teenage smoking out of control, when everyone knows smoking kills? What makes TV shows like Sesame Street so good at teaching kids how to read? Why did Paul Revere succeed with his famous warning? In this brilliant and groundbreaking book, New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell looks at why major changes in our society so often happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Ideas, behavior, messages, and products, he argues, often spread like outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave, or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the Tipping Point.   <P>In The Tipping Point, Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics. The Tipping Point is an intellectual adventure story written with an infectious enthusiasm for the power and joy of new ideas. Most of all, it is a road map to change, with a profoundly hopeful message--that one imaginative person applying a well-placed lever can move the world."}},

  abstract={The minimum description length (MDL) principle is a powerful method of inductive inference, the basis of statistical modeling, pattern recognition, and machine learning. It holds that the best explanation, given a limited set of observed data, is the one that permits the greatest compression of the data. MDL methods are particularly well-suited for dealing with model selection, prediction, and estimation problems in situations where the models under consideration can be arbitrarily complex, and overfitting the data is a serious concern. This extensive, step-by-step introduction to the MDL Principle provides a comprehensive reference (with an emphasis on conceptual issues) that is accessible to graduate students and researchers in statistics, pattern classification, machine learning, and data mining, to philosophers interested in the foundations of statistics, and to researchers in other applied sciences that involve model selection, including biology, econometrics, and experimental psychology. Part I provides a basic introduction to MDL and an overview of the concepts in statistics and information theory needed to understand MDL. Part II treats universal coding, the information-theoretic notion on which MDL is built, and part III gives a formal treatment of MDL theory as a theory of inductive inference based on universal coding. Part IV provides a comprehensive overview of the statistical theory of exponential families with an emphasis on their information-theoretic properties. The text includes a number of summaries, paragraphs offering the reader a \&quot;fast track\&quot; through the material, and boxes highlighting the most important concepts.},

    Abstract = {The research access/impact problem arises because journal articles are not accessible to all of their would-be users; hence, they are losing potential research impact. The solution is to make all articles open access (OA, i.e., accessible online, free for all). OA articles have significantly higher citation impact than non-OA articles. There are two roads to OA: the ?golden? road (publish your article in an OA journal) and the ?green? road (publish your article in a non-OA journal but also self-archive it in an OA archive). About 10\% of journals are gold, but over 90\% are already green (i.e., they have given their authors the green light to self-archive); yet only about 10?20\% of articles have been self-archived. To reach 100\% OA, self-archiving needs to be mandated by researchers? employers and funders, as they are now increasingly beginning to do.},

Our algorithm constructs policies incrementally, starting from a policy which makes no use of the available information. The incremental process constructs policies which includes more of the information available to the decision maker at each step. While the process converges to the optimal policy, our approach is designed for situations in which computing the optimal policy is infeasible. We provide examples of the process on several large decision problems, showing that, for these examples, the process constructs valuable (but sub-optimal) policies before the optimal policy would be available by traditional methods. 1}},

    Comment = {When costs of computation are not taken into account, optimal policies can be determined using dynamic programming [Howard and Matheson, 1984; Shachter, 1986]. When the costs of computation are not negligible, the cost of computing the optimal policy using dynamic programming may be prohibitive. We have developed an algorithm which can be used to compute policies for large multi-stage decision problems under uncertainty represented as influence diagrams. Our approach is incremental, and uses abstraction. An influence diagram(ID) is a DAG representing a sequential decision problem under uncertainty [Howard and Matheson, 1984]. An ID models the subjective beliefs, preferences, and available actions from the perspective of a single decision maker. A decision tree represents a decision function. The single stage information refinement algorithm constructs a decision tree for a influence diagram with a single decision node. A policy is represented by a collection of decision trees, one for each decision node in the influence diagram. A deterministic decision tree is an inappropriate representation for a decision function in a multi-stage policywhich is being refined. For multi--stage decision problems, the refinement may have ramifications for the global policy. Neither of these complications occur for single-stage problems.},

In this research, we examined the impact of cultural intelligence (CQ) on intercultural negotiation processes and outcomes, controlling for other types of intelligence (cognitive ability and emotional intelligence), personality (openness and extraversion), and international experience. Transcripts of 124 American and East Asian negotiators were coded for sequences of integrative information behaviors and cooperative relationship management behaviors. CQ measured a week prior to negotiations predicted the extent to which negotiators sequenced integrative information behaviors, which in turn predicted joint profit, over and beyond other individual differences. Additional analyses revealed that the level of integrative sequencing was more a function of the lower-scoring than the higher-scoring negotiator within the dyad. Other individual difference characteristics were not related to effective intercultural negotiation processes. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

This paper describes the development of a scalable process for people and machines working together to identify sections of text that reflect specific human values. A total of 2,005 sentences from 28 prepared testimonies presented before hearings on Net neutrality were manually annotated for one or more of ten human values using an annotation frame based on experience annotating similar content using the Schwartz Values Inventory. Moderately good agreement suggests that meaningful distinctions can often be drawn by human annotators. Several k-Nearest-Neighbor classifiers were compared in this preliminary study, yielding results that appear promising and that clearly point to productive directions for future work.},

    Abstract = {
    Topic models have been studied extensively in the context of
    monolingual corpora. Though there are some attempts to mine topical
    structure from cross-lingual corpora, they require clues about document
    alignments. In this paper we present a generative model called JointLDA
    which uses a bilingual dictionary to mine multilingual topics from an
    unaligned corpus. Experiments conducted on different data sets confirm
    our conjecture that jointly modeling the cross-lingual corpora offers several
    advantages compared to individual monolingual models. Since the
    JointLDA model merges related topics in different languages into a single
    multilingual topic: a) it can fit the data with relatively fewer topics. b)
    it has the ability to predict related words from a language different than
    that of the given document. In fact it has better predictive power compared
    to the bag-of-word based translation model leaving the possibility
    for JointLDA to be preferred over bag-of-word model for cross-lingual
    IR applications. We also found that the monolingual models learnt while
    optimizing the cross-lingual copora are more effective than the corresponding
    LDA models.

@article{jurafsky-96,
    Abstract = {{The problems of access--retrieving linguistic structure from some mental grammar --and disambiguation--choosing among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous linguistic input--are fundamental to language understanding. The literature abounds with psychological results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation, and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to combine models which account for these results to build a general, uniform model of access and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic levels. For example, psycholinguistic theories of lexical access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or coverage of psycholinguistic data. This article presents a single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions for access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path effect. I show that this motivated probabilistic treatment accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results, arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic knowledge and for the use of probabilistically-enriched grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.}},

                  language tree structures in which semantic (lexical

                  scored with separate models. This factorization
                  provides conceptual simplicity, straightforward
                  opportunities for separately improving the component
                  models and a level of performance comparable to
                  similar, non-factored models. Most importantly,
                  unlike other modern parsing models, the factored
                  model admits an extremely effective A* parsing
                  algorithm, which enables efficient, exact

    Abstract = {Einstein@Home aggregates the computer power of hundreds of thousands of volunteers from 192 countries to "mine" large data sets. It has now found a 40.8-hertz isolated pulsar in radio survey data from the Arecibo Observatory taken in February 2007. Additional timing observations indicate that this pulsar is likely a disrupted recycled pulsar. PSR J2007+2722's pulse profile is remarkably wide with emission over almost the entire spin period; the pulsar likely has closely aligned magnetic and spin axes. The massive computing power provided by volunteers should enable many more such discoveries.

    abstract = {{In addition to the actual content Web pages consist of navigational elements, templates, and advertisements. This boilerplate text typically is not related to the main content, may deteriorate search precision and thus needs to be detected properly. In this paper, we analyze a small set of shallow text features for classifying the individual text elements in a Web page. We compare the approach to complex, state-of-the-art techniques and show that competitive accuracy can be achieved, at almost no cost. Moreover, we derive a simple and plausible stochastic model for describing the boilerplate creation process. With the help of our model, we also quantify the impact of boilerplate removal to retrieval performance and show significant improvements over the baseline. Finally, we extend the principled approach by straight-forward heuristics, achieving a remarkable detection accuracy.}},

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data. 1.},

on the web to build a computerized player
for the ABC TV game show Who Wants To Be A

The question-answering module utilizes
question transformation techniques, natural language
parsing, multiple information retrieval algorithms,
and multiple search engines; results
are combined in the spirit of ensemble learning
using an adaptive weighting scheme. Empirically,
the system correctly answers about 75%
of questions from the Millionaire CD-ROM, 3rd
editiongeneral-interest trivia questions often
about popular culture and common knowledge.
The decision-making module chooses from allowable
actions in the game in order to maximize
expected risk-adjusted winnings, where the
estimated probability of answering correctly is a
function of past performance and confidence in
correctly answering the current question. When
given a six question head start (i.e., when starting
from the \$2,000 level), we find that the system
performs about as well on average as humans
starting at the beginning. Our system demonstrates
the potential of simple but well-chosen
techniques for mining answers from unstructured
information such as the web.},

    Abstract = {Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events. We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.},

Conditional random fields model the probability P(t|o) of a tag sequence given an observation sequence directly and have previously been employed successfully for other tagging tasks. The mechanics of CRFs and their relationship to maximum entropy are discussed in detail.RESULTS:We employ a diverse feature set containing standard orthographic features combined with expert features in the form of gene and biological term lexicons to achieve a precision of 86.4 and recall of 78.7\%. An analysis of the contribution of the various features of the model is provided.},

@article{miller-90,
    Abstract = {Definitions of common nouns typically give a superordinate term plus distinguishing features; that information provides the basis for organizing noun files in WordNet. The superordinate relation (hyponymy) generates a hierarchical semantic organization that is duplicated in the noun files by the use of labeled pointers between sets of synonyms (synsets). The hierarchy is limited in depth, seldom exceeding more than a dozen levels. Distinguishing features are entered in such a way as to create a lexical inheritance system, a system in which each word inherits the distinguishing features of all its superordinates. Three types of distinguishing features are discussed: attributes (modification), parts (meronymy) and functions (predication), but only meronymy is presently implemented in the noun files. Antonymy is also found between nouns, but it is not a fundamental organizing principle for nouns.  Coverage is partitioned into twenty-five topical files, each of which deals with a different primitive semantic component. Characteristics of each topic are discussed.

    Abstract = {The relationship between semantic and contextual similarity is investigated for pairs of nouns that vary from high to low semantic similarity. Semantic similarity is estimated by subjective ratings; contextual similarity is estimated by the method of sorting sentential contexts. The results show an inverse linear relationship between similarity of meaning and the discriminability of contexts. This relation, is obtained for two separate corpora of sentence contexts. It is concluded that, on average, for words in the same language drawn from the same syntactic and semantic categories, the more often two words can be substituted into the same contexts the more similar in meaning they are judged to be.},

Based on the observation that one Wikipedia concept may be described by articles in different languages, we adapt existing topic modeling algorithm for mining multilingual topics from this knowledge base. The extracted ?universal? topics have multiple types of representations, with each type corresponding to one language. Accordingly, new documents of different languages can be represented in a space using a group of universal topics, which makes various multilingual Web applications feasible.},

    Abstract = {In this paper, we will review the state of the art in dependency-based parsing, starting with the theoretical foundations of dependency grammar and moving on to consider both grammar-driven and data-driven methods for dependency parsing. We will limit our attention to systems for dependency parsing in a narrow sense, i.e. systems where the analysis assigned to an input sentence takes the form of a dependency structure. This means that we will not discuss systems that exploit dependency relations for the construction of another type of representation, such as the head-driven parsing models of Collins (1997, 1999). Moreover, we will restrict ourselves to systems for full parsing, which means that we will not deal with systems that produce a partial or underspecified representation of dependency structure, such as Constraint Grammar parsers (Karlsson, 1990; Karlsson et al., 1995).},

    abstract = {{10.1518/001872006776412180 Objective: The present study examined the relationship between two distinct subfactors of spatial ability and performance in an information search task modeled on browsing the Web. Background: Previous studies have found relationships between various measures of spatial ability and performance in a wide variety of computerbased tasks. Method: In the search task 101 participants (18-29 years of age) searched for the answer to a question by navigating the system. They completed the experimental task as well as a battery of cognitive ability measures that included two different measures of spatial ability. Results: The results indicate that spatial orientation ability was related to performance with tasks that were high in their navigational requirement (engendered by the use of a novel aid), whereas spatial visualization was unrelated to performance in any task condition. Conclusion: A closer inspection of the cognitive requirements of a task may reveal what interventions could be most useful when designing computer systems or developing training programs. Application: Given the unique differences between the different spatial abilities, the current results suggest the design of navigational aids that place less demand on spatial orientation ability.

    Abstract = {An important part of our information-gathering
                  behavior has always been to find out what other
                  people think. With the growing availability and
                  popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online
                  review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities
                  and challenges arise as people can and do, actively
                  use information technologies to seek out and
                  understand the opinions of others. The sudden
                  eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining
                  and sentiment analysis, which deals with the
                  computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and
                  subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in
                  part as a direct response to the surge of interest
                  in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a
                  first-class object. Opinion Mining and Sentiment
                  Analysis covers techniques and approaches that
                  promise to directly enable opinion-oriented
                  information-seeking systems. The focus is on methods
                  that seek to address the new challenges raised by
                  available resources, benchmark datasets, and
                  evaluation campaigns is also provided. Opinion
                  Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such
                  comprehensive survey of this vibrant and important
                  research area and will be of interest to anyone with
                  sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those
                  that are already present in more traditional
                  fact-based analysis. The survey includes an
                  enumeration of the various applications, a look at
                  general challenges and discusses categorization,
                  extraction and summarization. Finally, it moves
                  beyond just the technical issues, devoting
                  significant attention to the broader implications
                  that the development of opinion-oriented
                  information-access services have: questions of
                  privacy, vulnerability to manipulation and whether
                  or not reviews can have measurable economic
                  impact. To facilitate future work, a discussion of
                  available resources, benchmark datasets, and
                  evaluation campaigns is also provided. Opinion
                  Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such

    Abstract = {Language, whether spoken or written, is an important window into people's
emotional and cognitive worlds. Text analysis of these narratives, focusing on
specific words or classes of words, has been used in numerous research studies
including studies of emotional, cognitive, structural and process components
of individuals' verbal and written language. It was in this research context
that the LIWC program was developed. The program analyzes text files on a
word-by-word basis, calculating percentage words that match each of several
language dimensions. Its output is a text file that can be opened in any of a
variety of applications, including word processors and spreadsheet programs.
The program has 68 pre-set dimensions (output variables) including linguistic
dimensions, word categories tapping psychological constructs and personal
concern categories and can accommodate user-defined dimensions as well. Easy
to install and use, this software offers researchers in social, personality,
clinical and applied psychology a valuable tool for quantifying the rich but
often slippery data provided in the form of personal narratives. The software
comes complete on one  diskette and runs on any Windows-based computer.},

@article{pitman-97,
    Abstract = {The two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution, denoted $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \theta)$ is a probability distribution on the set of decreasing positive sequences with sum 1. The usual Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a single parameter $\theta$, introduced by Kingman, is $\mathsf{PD}(0, \theta)$. Known properties of $\mathsf{PD}(0, \theta)$, including the Markov chain description due to Vershik, Shmidt and Ignatov, are generalized to the two-parameter case. The size-biased random permutation of $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \theta)$ is a simple residual allocation model proposed by Engen in the context of species diversity and rediscovered by Perman and the authors in the study of excursions of Brownian motion and Bessel processes. For $0 < \alpha < 1, \mathsf{PD}(\alpha, 0)$ is the asymptotic distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a Markov chain away from a state whose recurrence time distribution is in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha$. Formulae in this case trace back to work of Darling, Lamperti and Wendel in the 1950s and 1960s. The distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a one-dimensional Brownian motion is $\mathsf{PD}(1/2, 0)$ and the corresponding distribution for a Brownian bredge is $\mathsf{PD}(1/2, 1/2)$. The $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, 0)$ and $\mathsf{PD}(\alpha, \alpha)$ distributions admit a similar interpretation in terms of the ranked lengths of excursions of a semistable Markov process whose zero set is the range of a stable subordinator of index $\alpha$.},

    Abstract = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al. for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is available at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

    Abstract = {This tutorial provides an overview of the basic theory of hidden Markov models (HMMs) as originated by L.E. Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described},

For all of them linguistics is of basic importance: its data and methods show better than those of any other discipline dealing with socialized behavior the possibility of a truly scientific study of society. Linguists should, on the other hand, become aware of what their science may mean for the interpretation of human conduct in general.},

The theory also postulates a structure of relations among the value types, based on the conflicts and compatibilities experienced when pursuing them. This structure permits one to relate systems of value priorities, as an integrated whole, to other variables. A new values instrument, based on the theory and suitable for cross-cultural research, is described. Evidence relevant for assessing the theory, from 97 samples in 44 countries, is summarized. Relations of this approach to Rokeach's work on values and to other theories and research on value dimensions are discussed. Application of the approach to social issues is exemplified in the domains of politics and intergroup relations.}},

    abstract = {{The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer labeled training instances if it is allowed to choose the training data from which is learns. An active learner may ask queries in the form of unlabeled instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for active learning, a summary of several problem setting variants, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented.}},

@article{sinha-10,
    Abstract = {{Using a sentiment score provided by Thomson Reuters to measure the tone of news articles, this paper examines monthly portfolio returns constructed from information about past news articles. The sentiment score is obtained from the kind of words and phrases that are used in the news article. Positive tone in news articles in the past months predicts positive returns. Similarly, negative tone in the past months predicts negative returns. Past sentiment predicts future returns even for large stocks. The predictive ability of past sentiment dominates the predictive ability of past returns. After controlling for past sentiment, the predictive ability of past returns (in predicting future return) disappears. The findings are robust to multiple specifications. The predictive ability of past sentiment can be used profitably. When applied to the largest decile of stocks, a strategy that takes a long position in stocks with past positive sentiment score and a short position in stocks with past negative sentiment score generates a statistically significant alpha of 34 basis points per month. The resulting portfolio is also positively correlated with a long-short momentum portfolio. Within the same time period, a trading strategy using the sentiment scores from the subset of news articles citing analysts is not profitable. The news items that cite analysts have economically significant contemporaneous returns. The findings suggest that (i) the market underreacts to information contained in news articles, (ii) momentum might be related to underreaction to the sentiment information, and (iii) market participants pay attention to sentiment score information in analyst news. The findings are consistent with a model where one trader has private information and others are trading based on past returns and volume information.}},

Dirichlet mixture densities are designed to be combined with observed amino acid frequencies to form estimates of expected amino acid probabilities at each position in a profile, hidden Markov model or other statistical model. These estimates give a statistical model greater generalization capacity, so that remotely related family members can be more reliably recognized by the model. This paper corrects the previously published formula for estimating these expected probabilities, and contains complete derivations of the Dirichlet mixture formulas, methods for optimizing the mixtures to match particular databases, and suggestions for efficient implementation.}},

This version, called cumulative prospect theory, applies to uncertain as well as to risky prospects with any number of outcomes, and it allows different weighting functions for gains and for losses. Two principles, diminishing sensitivity and loss aversion, are invoked to explain the characteristic curvature of the value function and the weighting functions. A review of the experimental evidence and the results of a new experiment confirm a distinctive fourfold pattern of risk attitudes: risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses of high probability; risk seeking for gains and risk aversion for losses of low probability.}},

    Abstract = {{This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet, which is  the building of a multilingual database with lexical semantic networks  or wordnets for several European languages. Each wordnet in the  database represents a language-specific structure due to the unique  lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are inter-linked  via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where equivalent concepts across  languages should share the same index item. The flexible multilingual  design of the database makes it possible to compare the  lexicalizations and semantic structures, revealing answers to  fundamental linguistic and philosophical questions which could never  be answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic networks  across languages, what are the language-specific differences of these  networks, is there a language-universal ontology, how much information  can be shared across languages? First attempts to answer these  questions are given in the form of a set of shared or common Base  Concepts that has been derived from the separate wordnets and their  classification by a language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts  play a fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the  database may also serve many practical needs with respect to  (cross-language) information retrieval, machine translation tools,  language generation tools and language learning tools, which are  discussed in the final chapter. <br/>  The book offers an excellent introduction to the EuroWordNet project  for scholars in the field and raises many issues that set the  directions for further research in semantics and knowledge  engineering.}},

    Abstract = {In this paper, we develop the continuous time
dynamic topic model (cDTM). The cDTM is
a dynamic topic model that uses Brownian
motion to model the latent topics through
a sequential collection of documents, where
a  ``topic'' is a pattern of word use that we
expect to evolve over the course of the col-
lection. We derive an efficient variational
approximate inference algorithm that takes
advantage of the sparsity of observations in
text, a property that lets us easily han-
dle many time points. In contrast to the
cDTM, the original discrete-time dynamic
topic model (dDTM) requires that time be
discretized. Moreover, the complexity of vari-
ational inference for the dDTM grows quickly
as time granularity increases, a drawback
which limits fne-grained discretization. We
demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora,
reporting both predictive perplexity and the
novel task of time stamp prediction.},

    Abstract = {{This paper introduces the notion of temporally constrained ranked retrieval, which, given a query and a time constraint, produces the best possible ranked list within the specified time limit. Naturally, more time should translate into bet- ter results, but the ranking algorithm should always pro- duce some results. This property is desirable from a number of perspectives: to cope with diverse users and information needs, as well as to better manage system load and variance in query execution times. We propose two temporally con- strained ranking algorithms based on a class of probabilistic prediction models that can naturally incorporate efficiency constraints: one that makes independent feature selection de- cisions, and the other that makes joint feature selection de- cisions. Experiments on three different test collections show that both ranking algorithms are able to satisfy imposed time constraints, although the joint model outperforms the independent model in being able to deliver more effective results, especially under tight time constraints, due to its ability to capture feature dependencies.}},

We present TreeMiner, a novel algorithm to discover all frequent subtrees in a forest, using a new data structure called scope-list. We contrast TreeMiner with a pattern matching tree mining algorithm (PatternMatcher), and we also compare it with TreeMinerD, which counts only distinct occurrences of a pattern. We conduct detailed experiments to test the performance and scalability of these methods. We also use tree mining to analyze RNA structure and phylogenetics data sets from bioinformatics domain.}},

    Abstract = {This paper describes an automatic text analysis of values contained in the Enron email dataset that seeks to explore the potential to apply value patterns to cluster a social network. Two hypotheses are posed: individuals communicate more frequently with other individuals who share similar value patterns than with individuals with different value patterns; and people who communicate more frequently with each other share similar value patterns. The first hypothesis is supported: indeed, individuals were found to communicate more frequently with individuals who share similar value patterns, and further, the extent to which this is true appears to depend at least in part on the value patterns themselves. However, the second hypothesis is not supported - people who communicate more frequently with each other do not necessarily all fit into a particular value type. Thus, values have utility as a novel tool for social network analysis.},

    Abstract = {Latent Dirichlet Allocation models a document by a mixture of topics, where each topic itself is typically modeled by a unigram word distribution. Documents however often have known structures and the same topic can exhibit different word distributions under different parts of the structure. We extend latent Dirichlet allocation model by replacing the unigram word distributions with a factored representation conditioned on both the topic and the structure. In the resultant model each topic is equivalent to a set of unigrams, reflecting the structure a word is in. The proposed model is more flexible in modeling the corpus. The factored representation prevents combinatorial explosion and leads to efficient parameterization. We derive the variational optimization algorithm for the new model. The model shows improved perplexity on text and image data, but no significant accuracy improvement when used for classification.},

  abstract = {How do we decide how to represent an intelligent system in its interface, and how do we decide how the interface represents information about the world and about its own workings to a user? This article addresses these questions by examining the interaction between representation and intelligence in user interfaces. The rubric representation covers at least three topics in this context: (1) how a computational system is represented in its user interface, (2) how the interface conveys its representations of information and the world to human users, and (3) how the system's internal representation affects the human user's interaction with the system. I argue that each of these kinds of representation (of the system, information and the world, the interaction) is key to how users make the kind of attributions of intelligence that facilitate their interactions with intelligent systems. In this vein, it makes sense to represent a systmem as a human in those cases where social collaborative behavior is key and for the system to represent its knowledge to humans in multiple ways on multiple modalities. I demonstrate these claims by discussing issues of representation and intelligence in an embodied conversational agent -- an interface in which the system is represented as a person, information is conveyed to human users by multiple modalities such as voice and hand gestures, and the internal representation is modality independent and both propositional and nonpropositional.},

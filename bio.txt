Jordan Boyd-Graber is an assistant professor in the University of
Colorado Boulder's Computer Science Department (a Colorado native),
formerly serving as an assistant professor at the University of
Maryland. Before joining Maryland in 2010, he did his PhD with David
Blei at Princeton. Jordan's research focus is in applying machine
learning and Bayesian probabilistic models to problems that help us
better understand social interaction or the human cognitive
process. He and his students have won "best of" awards at NIPS (2009,
2015), NAACL (2016), and CoNLL (2015), and Jordan won the British
Computing Society's 2015 Karen Sp√§rk Jones Award and a 2017 NSF CAREER
award. His research has been funded by DARPA, IARPA, NSF, NCSES, ARL,
NIH, and Lockheed Martin and has been featured by CNN, Huffington
Post, New York Magazine, and the Wall Street Journal.

=============================================

Jordan Boyd-Graber is an assistant professor in the University of
Colorado Boulder's Computer Science Department, formerly serving as
an assistant professor at the University of Maryland.  He is a 2010
graduate of Princeton University, with a PhD thesis on "Linguistic
Extensions of Topic Models" with David Blei.  Jordan's
research focus is in applying machine learning and Bayesian
probabilistic models to problems that help us better understand social
interaction or the human cognitive process.  This research often leads
him to use tools such as large-scale inference for probabilistic
methods, natural language processing, multilingual corpus
understanding, and human computation.

One facet of this research is developing topic models, completely automatic
tools that can discover structure and meaning in large, multilingual datasets.
His research has developed new techniques to evaluate topic models, enable
interactivity in machine learning algorithms, and to expose how topics interact
with culture and sentiment.  His research has been supported by NSF, IARPA, and
ARL.

He has received the CoNLL 2015 Best Paper Award, a NIPS 2009 Best
Student Paper award honorable mention, a Computing Innovation
Fellowship (declined), and received the Jorgensen scholarship while an
undergrad at the California Institute of Technology, where he received
a BS in computer science and in history in 2004.

=============================================

Dr. Boyd-Graber's specific research contributions to topic modeling include:

  * User-Centric Evaluation: With collaborator Jonathan Chang, he developed the
    first human-centered evaluation of the quality of topic models.  This work
    overturned the previous approach of solely using machine learning evaluation
    techniques.

  * Interactivity: With his student Yuening Hu, he developed interactive topic
    modeling, which allows users to repair topics that are incoherent or are
    inconsistent with a user's needs.

  * Scalability: With his student Ke Zhai, he developed efficient algorithms for
    topic model inference across large datasets.

  * Multilinguality: He developed the first topic models that could be applied
    to unaligned multilingual corpora.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Annual evaluations
  \item Better representation: 90\% of SQuAD questions about men (Manchester)
  \item Next generation of adversarial questions (Manchester)
  \item Multilingual: Need to actually represent culture and langauge (Cranfield)
  \item Combine with speech recognition

\begin{frame}{Imitation Game}

  I believe that in about fifty years’ time it will be possible to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 109, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. \dots I believe that at the \alert<2>{end of the century} the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that \alert<2>{one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bring community together
  \item Opportunity for education: simple to build competitive system
  \item Force people to look at the data
  \item Fair human comparisons (and understand AI weaknesses)
  \item Slowly increase the difficulty
